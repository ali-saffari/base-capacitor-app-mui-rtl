4. [MUI (Material Ul)](https://mui.com/) Ui Library.
4. [stylis-plugin-rtl](https://mui.com/) for `let` To `rtl` (For Persian,Arabic,... ).
4. font [IRANYekan](https://mui.com/) for Persian (I set the font for example. You can use your own font).

This sample code is based on my `rtl` needs, which you can easily migrate to `ltr` if needed.
To do this, go to the `index.tsx` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `yarn android`


Builds the app for production to the `android` folder.\

Open the aa folder in Android Studio and build the final Android file.

Note: You must build `yarn build` before executing this command

See the [Capacitor Android Documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/android) for more information

## For IOS

Because we did not need the iOS version, we did not install the required package. But do not worry, you can do it easily.

See the [Capacitor iOS Documentation](https://capacitorjs.com/docs/ios)
